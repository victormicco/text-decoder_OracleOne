# Text Encryption

Welcome to our text encryption project! A challenge from Oracle One Bootcamp

## Project Description

My application will utilize a simple encryption method, substituting certain letters with others, according to the following rules:

- "e" will be converted to "enter"
- "i" will be converted to "imes"
- "a" will be converted to "ai"
- "o" will be converted to "ober"
- "u" will be converted to "ufat"

Project requirements include:

- Exclusive functionality with lowercase letters.
- No usage of letters with accents or special characters.
- The ability to convert a word to its encrypted version and also return an encrypted word to its original version.

For example:

- "gato" will be encrypted as "gaitober"
- "gaitober" will be decrypted as "gato"

My application page will have fields for entering the text to be encrypted or decrypted, with the option to choose between the two functions. The result will be displayed on the screen for the user.

## Usage Instructions

1. Enter the text in the designated field.
2. Select either "Encrypt" or "Decrypt", as needed.
3. Click the "Process" button.
4. The result will be displayed in the output area.

## Next Steps

This is just the beginning! Stay tuned for updates and exciting news.
